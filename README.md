FindersSneakers
=========

A buy/sell listing app that lets you sell your sneakers and browse sneakers available for sale. It's like Craiglist and Kijiji, but with a focus on sneakers!

The app is a collaboration project created by Gloria Cheung, Osama Abdul Rahman, and Raiza De Guzman, as a way to further practice the tech and approaches learned to date at Lighthouse Labs. The project also allowed for practice utilizing the major steps of software development such as, user stories, wireframes, ERD, Routes, etc.

## Stacks Used for Project's Development

* ES6 for server-side (`NodeJS`) code
* `NodeJS`
* `Express`
   * RESTful routes
* `jQuery`
* `CSS`
   * Framework: `Bootstrap`
   * Preprocessor: `SASS`
   * Custom `CSS` properties
* `PostgreSQL` and `pg` (with promises) for DBMS
* `git` for version control


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss` 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
